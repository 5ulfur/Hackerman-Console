I created this tool to help during CTFs and I will add new modules or attacks to existing modules every time I face a new challenge.

Feel free to create pull requests to improve modules or add new ones.

To add a new module just create a new python file in the modules folder, and it will be automatically detected by the console. The menu function will be the starting point of the module.
